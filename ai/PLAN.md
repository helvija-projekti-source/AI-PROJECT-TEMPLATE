Plan (current iteration)

1. Repository baseline
- Confirm Vite + vanilla JS entry and starter UI exist
- Confirm version is displayed from `package.json`

2. Hosting configuration
- Add `firebase.json` to serve `dist/` with SPA rewrites

3. Documentation
- Update `README.md` with dev, build, and Firebase Hosting steps

4. Validation (manual)
- Run `npm run dev`
- Run `npm run build` and `npm run preview`
- Optionally test Firebase Hosting via emulator or deploy
