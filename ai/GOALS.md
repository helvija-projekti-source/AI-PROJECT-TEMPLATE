Current goal:
Bootstrap a Firebase-hosted PWA/web app template with a simple starter UI.

Requirements:
- Works as a single-page app
- Ready for Firebase Hosting deploy
- Easy to extend with new features
1) Build reusable AI-first project template for fast web apps (PWA-ready later).
2) Default stack: Vite + Vanilla JS + CSS, deployable to Firebase Hosting.
3) AI works via: update SPEC/PLAN/TASKS, implement, run, commit.
